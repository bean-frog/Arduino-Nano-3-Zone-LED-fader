# Arduino-Nano-3-Zone-LED-fader

***CURRENTLY UNFINISHED***


Used pins are in the top comment section in the .ino file
fades between cooler colors, to switch to warmer colors, change some of the blue and greens to red (look up rgb color blending for ideas I guess)
connect a common VCC from the 5v pin on the nano (use 5v led strips duhhh) and connect the r, g, and b pins according to the comments in the code.
I recommend using 5-10 LEDs per zone, to ensure enough power can get to each (or just use a slightly stronger powersupply, the VIN pin can handle up to 12 volts if I remember correctly.
if you actually know how to code well instead of "borrowing" and/or have improvement ideas make a PR
